## Description

A React login app made to demonstrate how we can optimize a form/input validation. To do so, I've used debounce with the help of the useEffect hook and a "setTimeout" method, which limits the number of times the validation code executes, running only after a period of time we stop typing, giving a chance for the user to type a valid input.

### Goal

My Goal for this app was to implement debounce by my own in order to practice what I've learned in React. The app's CSS was inspired by a similar app made with Vanilla JavaScript by the Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia" target="_blank">Traversy Media</a>. This was a perfect opportunity to put in place something like this, since I had to implement React by my own.
